= GBIF Document Private Sector Data Publishing

_This is information *about* this document's source code.  It is not part of the document._

The document is available as HTML and PDF at https://docs.gbif.org/private-sector-data-publishing/2.0/[Private Sector Data Publishing].

The document is built using AsciiDoc, for guidance on how to make changes or suggestions see the https://docs.gbif.org/documentation-guidelines/[GBIF Documentation Guidelines].

== "Who publishes data" table

The https://docs.gbif.org/private-sector-data-publishing/2.0/en/#who-publishes-data-through-gbif[Who publishes data through GBIF?] table is updated automatically based on information in the GBIF Registry.  Registry editors with the appropriate permission can add machine tags to organizations (https://registry.gbif.org/organization/ca11748e-a30a-4252-930f-bdb017e942c5/machineTag[example]) and datasets (https://registry.gbif.org/dataset/72e23311-b65a-46d0-bc07-ff0a251b47e1/machineTag[example]).

At present, the changes are only put on the https://docs.gbif-uat.org/private-sector-data-publishing/2.0/en/[UAT document], so a release is needed to publish them.

The permission in the Registry to make these changes is the machine tag namespace `privateSector.gbif.org`, available under "Scopes" on a user page (https://registry.gbif.org/user/akristensen[example]).

In case of problems, see what the CSV file looks like in Github (https://github.com/gbif/doc-private-sector-data-publishing/blob/2.0/250-private-sector-table.csv[table], https://github.com/gbif/doc-private-sector-data-publishing/blob/2.0/260-private-sector-totals.csv[totals]) â€” any warnings or inconsistencies are unlikely to be accepted by AsciiDoctor.
